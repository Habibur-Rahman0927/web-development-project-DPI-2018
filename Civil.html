										Though it may not be required, employers seek candidates who have completed formal training. Civil engineering technology programs are available at the certiﬁcate, associate degree and bachelor's degree levels. Academic programs are offered at accredited schools, colleges or universities. Coursework examines surveying, ﬂuid mechanics, structural analysis, steel design, statics and drafting. Programs are typically accredited through the ABET , which is the accreditation agency for engineering and technology programs.
