				Definition - What does Computer Science mean?
Computer science is the study of both computer hardware and software design. It encompasses both the study of theoretical algorithms and the practical problems involved in implementing them through computer hardware and software. The study of computer science has many branches, including artificial intelligence, software engineering, programming and computer graphics. The need for computer science as a discipline has grown as computers become more integrated into our day-to-day lives and technology continues to advance.The Computer Technology Computer and Graphics Technology program is designed primarily for students seeking employment with organizations that use computers to process, design, manage, and communicate information.

										<h3>Computer Systems</h3>
										<p>Key Growth FactorsAs organizations continue to increase their reliance on technology, computer systems analysts will be hired to architect new systems. Health care is a key industry for systems analyst job growth, as aggressive government mandates and funding initiatives continue to drive increases in electronic medical record (EMR) adoption, electronic prescription services and other health-centric software projects that require custom computer systems. The U.S. Department of Labor also predicts a 43% increase 
										in systems analyst hiring at IT consulting ﬁrms, which translates to a huge amount of freelance and contract employment opportunities in this position.
