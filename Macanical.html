The Mechanical Technology program at Monroe Community College prepares students for challenging careers in mechanical design. The mechanical designer of today requires knowledge in many areas including mechanical drafting, computer-aided drafting and design, machine shop, robotics and machine components.

										<p>
										Elementary algebra (Course I), geometry (Course II), and intermediate algebra (Course III) are required. If you are not proﬁcient in algebra or trigonometry, you should take MTH 090 and/or MTH 135 at MCC, or equivalent before starting Mechanical Technology. Recommended preparation includes an introductory drafting course in high school or equivalent work experience. We also recommend mechanical drawing, physics and at least one-half year .

							<h2>MACANICAL information</h2>
							<p>Mechanical Technology Nearly every product includes mechanical components that must be created by a mechanical designer. The Mechanical Technology program at Monroe Community College prepares students for challenging careers in mechanical design. The mechanical designer of today requires knowledge in many areas including mechanical drafting, computer-aided drafting and design, machine shop, robotics and machine components. Our Mechanical Technology program provides a thorough understanding of these concepts as they apply to today's high technology. In particular, our drafting and design courses emphasize the national standards for drafting and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing.
							PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Mechanical Technology program introduces the student to the principles, materials and equipment of mechanical technology. Emphasis is placed on computer-aided drafting/ design (CAD) and an understanding of basic machine 
							components. Graduates of the program should ﬁnd employment as CAD operators, engineering assistants. technicians and technical representatives.
							Mechanical Technology - Program Information Download Mechanical Technology Program Information Sheet Download CAD Certiﬁcate Program Information Sheet PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The mechanical technician must have a thorough knowledge of existing designs. Our foundation courses will provide knowledge of traditional mechanics, physics, mathematics, machine shop practices and machine theory. Subsequent courses build upon this basic knowledge to develop applications related to modern machine design
