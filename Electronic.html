        Learning about basic electronics and creating your own projects is a lot easier than you may think.  In this tutorial, we’re going to give you a brief overview of common electronic components and explain what their functions are.  You will then learn about schematic diagrams and how they are used to design and build circuits.  And finally, you will put this information to use by creating your first basic circuit.Learning about basic electronics and creating your own projects is a lot easier than you may think.
