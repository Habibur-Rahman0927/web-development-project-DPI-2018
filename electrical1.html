										<h3>Electrical </h3>
										<p>
										Electrical technology deals with all machines, tools, devices, and systems in which a current or a ﬂow of electrons takes place through conductors and metals. It involves the design and development of high-voltage systems and components 
										such as motors, generators, heaters, electrical power transmission and distribution systems, radio wave and optical systems, converters, and control systems for operating light and heavy machinery. Almost all of our low or high-tech gadgets today involve the use of electrical current to operate, making electrical energy the main- and possibly the only- factor to deﬁne what electrical technology is.

							<h2>Electrical DEFINetion</h2>
							<p>Hydraulic Turbine - Electric GeneratorDevelopment of Hybrid Electric VehiclesElectrical Systems Within a Wind Turbine Interactions among Professionals in Electrical Technology In order to design, produce, and maintain all the electrical equipment and services, a number of professionals, including engineers, technologists, and technicians, need to cooperate and supplement each other's skills and responsibilities. Electrical Engineers are mostly involved in the design theory and analysis of procedures, the development of new products or in activities such as problem identiﬁcation, technical solutions, and the further The design of an electrical system, most of the time, entails the use of electronic components, and this fact makes people use the terms “electrical" and “electronic" technology interchangeably. Both disciplines however, do require knowledge of mathematics and science and rely on the same engineering principles and same analytical skills to provide their high-performance products and services.
