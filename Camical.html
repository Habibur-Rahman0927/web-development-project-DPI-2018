					Chemical Engineering Technology – Environmental programs. Some graduates go on to study chemistry or chemical engineering at university. Depending on the university, and the choice of program, they may receive transfer credits for their study at Sheridan.
					On the laboratory side, careers are found in research and development, quality control, production support, and technical service and sales. On the industrial side, careers range from plant operations (using the latest in computer control systems) to technical sales and service for industrial equipment and chemicals.
